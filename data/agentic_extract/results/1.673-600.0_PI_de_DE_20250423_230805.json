The nozzle is shown with an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the direction of the spray. Above the nozzle, there is a plus sign (+) and a circular arrow, suggesting the ability to increase or adjust the power or pressure of the spray. The background is black, and the elements are in yellow, providing high contrast for visibility. This symbol likely represents a feature on a pressure washer that allows the user to vary the power of the water jet.",
