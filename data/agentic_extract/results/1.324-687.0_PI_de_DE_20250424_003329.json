It features a stylized depiction of a road with a sharp left turn, represented by a thick yellow line that curves to the left. Below the road depiction, there is an arrow pointing to the left, also in yellow. \n\nUnderneath the arrow, the text reads:\n\n**\"ROAD NARROWS\"**\n\nThis text is in uppercase and is centered below the arrow. The overall design suggests a cautionary message, likely indicating a change in road conditions ahead, such as a narrowing of the road. The use of high-contrast colors (black and yellow) is typical for warning signs to ensure visibility and convey urgency.",
